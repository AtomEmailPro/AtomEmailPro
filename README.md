## 🌐 Industry Background: Cold Email Tools Are Evolving

Cold email marketing is one of the most effective ways to reach leads, build connections, and grow your business.

But here's the problem:

| Problem | Most Email Tools Today |
|--------|------------------------|
| 💸 Expensive pricing | Monthly fees up to $99–$299 per seat |
| ⛔ Sending limits | Daily limits, shared IPs, sender bans |
| 🔒 Platform lock-in | You must use their SMTP or email platform |
| 📉 Poor inbox rates | Mass emails often go straight to spam |

> 🧩 That’s why businesses are now seeking **low-cost, high-control tools** that can send emails like real humans — without recurring costs.
